//Q)To find minimum no of operation to make all the elements zero
//Convert the subarray into min(that is zero)that is not present in subarray

//logic

// In this question answer could not be greater than 2 
// 1) first take range l to r convert the range into min of the subarray then covert into zero means max 2 steps.
// if all are zero then step is zero
// if a[1,2,3,4,0,0,0] then ans is 1
